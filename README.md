A friend wanted help in some assignment he got for a job interview.
So I helped him, and make a version of my own for the project.

Fronted in Flutter, channel stable after the last amazing upgrades.
Backend in Flask.
MongoDB as the database of choice.

All in a single compose ready to run.

### Note:
* The front is not completed yet.
* 3rd part of the assignment not ready.

#### Work in progress :)

In order to use some regex, I searched for [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/) for some predefined regex.
https://pub.dev/packages/regexpattern - great package, not up to date...

Half an hour later:
https://github.com/agungnursatria/regexpattern/pull/4

add sound null safety
