A friend wanted help in some assignment he got for a job interview.
So I helped him, and make a version of my own for the project.

Fronted in Flutter, channel stable after the last amazing upgrades.
Backend in Flask.
MongoDB as the database of choice.

All in a single compose ready to run.

### Note:
* The front is not completed yet.
* 3rd part of the assignment not ready.
** Work in progress :)
